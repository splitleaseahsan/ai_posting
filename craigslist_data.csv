Hybrid work/Commuters Quiet & Furn Pied-A-Terre Huge living room,"PROFESSIONALS- WEEKDAY ACCOMMODATION ONLY! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers. Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative! The apartment is listed as a Split Lease. I'm looking for a renter who needs a place for their in-office days. Your cost is calculated from the total room cost prorated to how many nights per week you use and I would be happy to provide you with a storage space for you to leave your things during the time you are away.

Especially now with COVID, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room 
- furnished with double bed
- closet
- chair and desk plus recliner
- Flat L7 TV 
In Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

NYC is an expensive place to live, so I need to ensure that you will be able to manage the costs of living while you are here.

Monthly rent includes access to building amenities (gym, locker room, saunas and pool) as well as wifi & Netflix.

I’m on Split Lease too, but the price will be about 10% cheaper here on Craigslist. Please don't hesitate to contact me via text messaging regarding details of the apartment.

Part of the week each week Quiet & Furn Pied-A-Terre Available,"AGE 50+ PROFESSIONALS- WEEKDAY ACCOMMODATION ONLY! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers. Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative! Especially now with COVID, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights. The apartment is listed as a Split Lease. I'm looking for a renter who needs a place for their in-office days. Your cost is calculated from the total room cost prorated to how many nights per week you use and I would be happy to provide you with a storage space for you to leave your things during the time you are away.

I’m on Split Lease too, but the price will be about 10% cheaper here on Craigslist.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, entertainment like Flat L7 TV, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months. The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Hybrid work schedule rental Quiet & Furn Pied-A-Terre Weekdays available,"Weekday Accommodation only! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers. Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative! This place is ideal for someone needing a space for their in-office days. I am looking for a part time tenant who needs the space for some, but not all, nights each week. Ideally something like Monday to Thursday nights would be great but I can be flexible with other split schedules as Friday to Sunday nights so reach out if you have any other split schedule. You would pay a nightly rate as advertised and you can also find me at Split Lease.

Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Part time Rent Quiet & Furnished Pied-A-Terre Avbl Mon-Thu Nights,"Weekday Accommodation only! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers.

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative!

These days, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests but also you always come back to the same place every week!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

"Rent weekdays, pay per night Quiet & Furn Pied-A-Terre","Weekday Accommodation only! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers. Monday-to-Friday roommates. 

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative! Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

"Rent weekdays, pay per night in Quiet & Furn Private Room","Weekday Accommodation only! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers. This room is available PART-TIME ONLY. I’m not looking for full-time renters. Just someone who would need my space for part of the week each week. Something like Monday to Friday nights or similar split schedules.

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative! Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Part-Week Tenants Fully Furn and Cozy Apt. Mon-Thu Nights Only,"Weekday Accommodation only! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers. Available for ideal guests who need the space for Monday to Thursday nights.

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative!

Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Pay p/night Quiet & Furn Pied-a-Terre for Mon-Thu Nights Only!!,"Weekday Accommodation only! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers. This apartment is available for commuters or hybrid workers needing a place for part of the week each week, mostly for the returning to office schedule. You can store things in this place since you will be coming back each week. 

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative! Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. 

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

- Full kitchen with complimentary coffee and tea

- Hosts live in the neighborhood and are always available to help

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative!

Especially now, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Pay p/night renting weekdays Quiet & Furn Pied-A-Terre Private bedroom ,"Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative! Pay per night in this weekdays accommodation only! It’s ideal for commuters or ""hybrid"" workers, people returning to the office or just needing a space part of the week each week.

Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. 

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

There will be one other male roommate plus myself. A 150 sq.ft, partially-furnished double bedroom will be available beginning 11/30/22. The 175' bedroom is already rented/occupied. I’m ideally looking for someone who needs my space for the weekdays each week for about 2 or 3 months.

Read again: Weekdays each week. Meaning schedules like Monday to Friday every week. 

The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and safe area.

There is a laundry room in the basement, and the air-conditioned living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side.

The 150' bedroom has 1 large east-facing window and an A/C. The 175' bedroom next to the 150' bedroom has 2 large east-facing windows and an A/C. My bedroom/bathroom is in another wing of the 1400 sq. ft apartment, on the other side of the far living room wall. The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a private entrance to a bathroom shared with one male. That private entrance is from the apt's hall. The other guy is clean and he has a private entrance through his bedroom-to-bathroom door.

(The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a high-quality full (double-sized) mattress on a metal bed frame and boxspring, a small black wooden seat/nightstand; a straight-backed, black cushioned-leather black wood chair, a straight-backed red wood chair, a collapsible desk, and a walk-in, double-door closet.)

Every room in the apt, including the living room, has the highest energy-efficiency air conditioners with numerous options: like digital temperature settings, timer-settings, constant cooling, fan settings, a ""dry"" setting for humid heat, and a money-saver setting that maintains a set temperature in the room so that electric bills are reasonable. On the Money-Saver settings, the ACs go on and off based on the set temperature and the temperature in the room. There’s also a L43 Flat screen TV in a shared space.

THE APT. HAS: HARDWOOD FLOORS; HIGH CEILINGS; A LARGE (180 sq. ft.) EAT-IN KITCHEN (W/STONE FLOOR AND WHITE CERAMIC COUNTER AND WALL TILES); THICK WALLS; AND COLORED, RECESSED LIGHTING IN THE HALL AND LIVING ROOM.

THE LARGE EAT-IN KITCHEN is 180 sq. ft. and square, NOT a narrow, galley-style kitchen. It has a large round glass table with chairs, A LARGE DISHWASHER, LARGE FRIG., LARGE STOVETOP/OVEN, A NEW, LARGE MICROWAVE, a toaster, a Crockpot/slow-cooker, other cooking equipment, etc. and decent cabinet space. The kitchen doesn't get crowded with 2 people, depending on what is being done.

THE BUILDING: Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and it has a marble lobby and stairs. The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls. Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet. There is no noise from other apts.

Total utility charges for gas, electric, and shared internet vary, generally $60-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are rarely more than $100 for a single person, depending on how heavy A/C usage is.

ABOUT ME: I'm a Stanford U. and Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights. I currently do legal research and write legal memoranda for my cousin's practice. I sometimes do legal editing for law students' papers.

My male roommate in the 175' middle bedroom works in IT design for Bloomberg. I was born and raised in NYC, in Greenwich Village and Murray Hill. My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home). I do some of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library. We are easygoing, friendly, clean, and respect people's privacy and need for quiet.

Visitors and occasional overnight guests are OK, as long as you know them well, and don't have frequent overnights. Exceptions can be mutually agreed on.

Graduate students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all likely to be fine. A reference of some sort would be appreciated.

"Available Mon-Thu Nights Only Large, Quiet & Furn Pied-A-Terre ","Weekdays accommodation only! This private bedroom is available for commuters or hybrid workers needing a place for part of the week each week, mostly for the returning to office schedule. You can store things in this place since you will be coming back each week. 

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative!

More people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

We offer a beautifully designed space with all new modern furnishings, beautiful NYC artwork, all natural fiber linens, handmade soaps, and a private entrance. We are ideally looking for someone who needs this space for the weekdays each week for about 2 or 3 months. Monday to Friday nights is a good split schedule. 

The space
We kindly ask prospective guests to read the following description:

- Apartment has two bedrooms with three beds in total (each measuring 80"" x 60"") - sleeps 6 people
- 100% natural down pillows/comforters (no synthetics)
- 100% cotton towels and sheets (no synthetics)
- L3 Flat screen TV
- Handmade Organic Soap and Shampoo
- Private entrance directly from the street (6 steps down)
- The building is heated with steam radiators, which can produce a 'knocking' noise when they turn on in the evening- please don't be alarmed, this is common in NYC buildings.
- The space is partially subterranean, and has only one window in each of the two bedrooms. The space is filled with day-light halogen lighting, plants throughout and an abundance of greenery, but it only has two windows.


Only minutes from two major subway lines which go directly to all of New York's major attractions ($2.75/subway ride), the apartment is also walking distance to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital & Medical Center.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

M-Th nights each week Large Bedroom in 3BR apt on Central Pak North!,"This is a GREAT, 1400 SQ. FT., RENOVATED 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apt. ACROSS THE STREET FROM CENTRAL PARK. There will be one other male roommate plus myself. A 150 sq.ft, partially-furnished double bedroom will be available beginning 11/30/22. The 175' bedroom is already rented/occupied. I’m looking for someone who needs this private bedroom for the weekdays each week. The important thing is that you have a part of the week each week schedule. You’d pay for only the nights you are there. 

The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and safe area.

There is a laundry room in the basement, and the air-conditioned living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side, all the way down Fifth Avenue to the Empire State Building.

The 150' bedroom has 1 large east-facing window and an A/C. The 175' bedroom next to the 150' bedroom has 2 large east-facing windows and an A/C. My bedroom/bathroom is in another wing of the 1400 sq. ft apartment, on the other side of the far living room wall. The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a private entrance to a bathroom shared with one male. That private entrance is from the apt's hall. The other guy is clean and he has a private entrance through his bedroom-to-bathroom door.

(The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a high-quality full (double-sized) mattress on a metal bed frame and boxspring, a small black wooden seat/nightstand; a straight-backed, black cushioned-leather black wood chair, a straight-backed red wood chair, a collapsible desk, and a walk-in, double-door closet.)

Every room in the apt, including the living room, has the highest energy-efficiency air conditioners with numerous options: like digital temperature settings, timer-settings, constant cooling, fan settings, a ""dry"" setting for humid heat, and a money-saver setting that maintains a set temperature in the room so that electric bills are reasonable. On the Money-Saver settings, the ACs go on and off based on the set temperature and the temperature in the room. There’s also a L43 Flat screen TV in a shared space.

THE APT. HAS: HARDWOOD FLOORS; HIGH CEILINGS; A LARGE (180 sq. ft.) EAT-IN KITCHEN (W/STONE FLOOR AND WHITE CERAMIC COUNTER AND WALL TILES); THICK WALLS; AND COLORED, RECESSED LIGHTING IN THE HALL AND LIVING ROOM.

THE BUILDING: Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and it has a marble lobby and stairs. The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls. Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet. There is no noise from other apts.

Total utility charges for gas, electric, and shared internet vary, generally $60-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are rarely more than $100 for a single person, depending on how heavy A/C usage is.

ABOUT ME: I'm a Stanford U. and Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights. I currently do legal research and write legal memoranda for my cousin's practice. I sometimes do legal editing for law students' papers.

My male roommate in the 175' middle bedroom works in IT design for Bloomberg. I was born and raised in NYC, in Greenwich Village and Murray Hill. My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home). I do some of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library. We are easygoing, friendly, clean, and respect people's privacy and need for quiet.

Visitors and occasional overnight guests are OK, as long as you know them well, and don't have frequent overnights. Exceptions can be mutually agreed on.

Graduate students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all likely to be fine. A reference of some sort would be appreciated.

Mon-Thu Nights Only!! Quiet & Furn Pied-A-Terre in priv 1bd,"Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative! We are offering weekdays accommodation only! This private room as a pied-a-terre is available for commuters or hybrid workers needing a place for part of the week each week, mostly for the returning to office schedule. 

Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights. You can store things in this room and they will be secure since you will be coming back each week. 

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

There will be one other male roommate plus myself. A 150 sq.ft, partially-furnished double bedroom will be available beginning 11/30/22. The 175' bedroom is already rented/occupied. This room is ideal for hybrid workers, people that have their home somewhere else but they are coming repeatedly to New York City so you will stay part of the week each week only! Like Monday to Friday nights or similar. The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and safe area.

There is a laundry room in the basement, and the air-conditioned living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side, all the way down Fifth Avenue to the Empire State Building.

The 150' bedroom has 1 large east-facing window and an A/C. The 175' bedroom next to the 150' bedroom has 2 large east-facing windows and an A/C. My bedroom/bathroom is in another wing of the 1400 sq. ft apartment, on the other side of the far living room wall. The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a private entrance to a bathroom shared with one male. That private entrance is from the apt's hall. The other guy is clean and he has a private entrance through his bedroom-to-bathroom door.

(The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a high-quality full (double-sized) mattress on a metal bed frame and boxspring, a small black wooden seat/nightstand; a straight-backed, black cushioned-leather black wood chair, a straight-backed red wood chair, a collapsible desk, and a walk-in, double-door closet.)

Every room in the apt, including the living room, has the highest energy-efficiency air conditioners with numerous options: like digital temperature settings, timer-settings, constant cooling, fan settings, a ""dry"" setting for humid heat, and a money-saver setting that maintains a set temperature in the room so that electric bills are reasonable. On the Money-Saver settings, the ACs go on and off based on the set temperature and the temperature in the room. There’s also a L43 Flat screen TV in a shared space.

THE BUILDING: Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and it has a marble lobby and stairs. The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls. Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet. There is no noise from other apts.

Total utility charges for gas, electric, and shared internet vary, generally $60-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are rarely more than $100 for a single person, depending on how heavy A/C usage is.

ABOUT ME: I'm a Stanford U. and Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights. I currently do legal research and write legal memoranda for my cousin's practice. I sometimes do legal editing for law students' papers.

My male roommate in the 175' middle bedroom works in IT design for Bloomberg. I was born and raised in NYC, in Greenwich Village and Murray Hill. My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home). I do some of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library. We are easygoing, friendly, clean, and respect people's privacy and need for quiet.

Visitors and occasional overnight guests are OK, as long as you know them well, and don't have frequent overnights. Exceptions can be mutually agreed on.

Graduate students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all likely to be fine. A reference of some sort would be appreciated.

Take a break with a run along the Hudson River or rent a bike. Take in the views from the High Line, indulge in old-world New York, exploring the cobblestone streets of Greenwich Village - all within minutes of my home.

"Pay p/Night M-Thurs ONLY! Spacious, Quiet & Furn Pied-A-Terre ","Weekday Accommodation only! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers.

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative!

Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

This place is ideal for hybrid workers, people that have their home somewhere else but they are coming repeatedly to New York City, like Monday to Friday nights

There will be one other male roommate plus myself. A 150 sq.ft, partially-furnished double bedroom will be available beginning 11/30/22. The 175' bedroom is already rented/occupied. The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and safe area.

There is a laundry room in the basement, and the air-conditioned living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side, all the way down Fifth Avenue to the Empire State Building.

The 150' bedroom has 1 large east-facing window and an A/C. The 175' bedroom next to the 150' bedroom has 2 large east-facing windows and an A/C. My bedroom/bathroom is in another wing of the 1400 sq. ft apartment, on the other side of the far living room wall. The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a private entrance to a bathroom shared with one male. That private entrance is from the apt's hall. The other guy is clean and he has a private entrance through his bedroom-to-bathroom door.

(The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a high-quality full (double-sized) mattress on a metal bed frame and boxspring, a small black wooden seat/nightstand; a straight-backed, black cushioned-leather black wood chair, a straight-backed red wood chair, a collapsible desk, and a walk-in, double-door closet.)

Every room in the apt, including the living room, has the highest energy-efficiency air conditioners with numerous options: like digital temperature settings, timer-settings, constant cooling, fan settings, a ""dry"" setting for humid heat, and a money-saver setting that maintains a set temperature in the room so that electric bills are reasonable. On the Money-Saver settings, the ACs go on and off based on the set temperature and the temperature in the room. There’s also a L43 Flat screen TV in a shared space.

THE APT. HAS: HARDWOOD FLOORS; HIGH CEILINGS; A LARGE (180 sq. ft.) EAT-IN KITCHEN (W/STONE FLOOR AND WHITE CERAMIC COUNTER AND WALL TILES); THICK WALLS; AND COLORED, RECESSED LIGHTING IN THE HALL AND LIVING ROOM.

THE LARGE EAT-IN KITCHEN is 180 sq. ft. and square, NOT a narrow, galley-style kitchen. It has a large round glass table with chairs, A LARGE DISHWASHER, LARGE FRIG., LARGE STOVETOP/OVEN, A NEW, LARGE MICROWAVE, a toaster, a Crockpot/slow-cooker, other cooking equipment, etc. and decent cabinet space. The kitchen doesn't get crowded with 2 people, depending on what is being done.

THE BUILDING: Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and it has a marble lobby and stairs. The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls. Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet. There is no noise from other apts.

Total utility charges for gas, electric, and shared internet vary, generally $60-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are rarely more than $100 for a single person, depending on how heavy A/C usage is.

ABOUT ME: I'm a Stanford U. and Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights. I currently do legal research and write legal memoranda for my cousin's practice. I sometimes do legal editing for law students' papers.

My male roommate in the 175' middle bedroom works in IT design for Bloomberg. I was born and raised in NYC, in Greenwich Village and Murray Hill. My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home). I do some of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library. We are easygoing, friendly, clean, and respect people's privacy and need for quiet.

Visitors and occasional overnight guests are OK, as long as you know them well, and don't have frequent overnights. Exceptions can be mutually agreed on.

Graduate students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all likely to be fine. A reference of some sort would be appreciated.

Pay p/night renting weekdays in Quiet & Furn Pied-A-Terre Priv. Roo,"Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative! Private room available PART-WEEK ONLY. I’m not looking for full-time renters. Just someone who would need a space for part of the week each week. Something like Monday to Friday nights or similar split schedules.

Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Large Bedroom in 3BR apt Central Pak North avble Part-Week ,"If you are looking for a Pied-a-terre situation, keep reading!
This is a GREAT, 1400 SQ. FT., RENOVATED 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apt. ACROSS THE STREET FROM CENTRAL PARK. There will be one other male roommate plus myself. A 150 sq.ft, partially-furnished double bedroom will be available beginning 11/30/22. The 175' bedroom is already rented/occupied. I am ideally looking for someone who needs a space for the weekdays or some of the weekdays each week. You’d pay for only the nights you are there and you can leave your things in the space since you will be coming back week after week. Ideal schedules are: Mon-Thurs nights, Mon-Fri nights, only weekends, etc 

The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and safe area.

There is a laundry room in the basement, and the air-conditioned living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side, all the way down Fifth Avenue to the Empire State Building.

The 150' bedroom has 1 large east-facing window and an A/C. The 175' bedroom next to the 150' bedroom has 2 large east-facing windows and an A/C. My bedroom/bathroom is in another wing of the 1400 sq. ft apartment, on the other side of the far living room wall. The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a private entrance to a bathroom shared with one male. That private entrance is from the apt's hall. The other guy is clean and he has a private entrance through his bedroom-to-bathroom door.

(The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a high-quality full (double-sized) mattress on a metal bed frame and boxspring, a small black wooden seat/nightstand; a straight-backed, black cushioned-leather black wood chair, a straight-backed red wood chair, a collapsible desk, and a walk-in, double-door closet.)

Every room in the apt, including the living room, has the highest energy-efficiency air conditioners with numerous options: like digital temperature settings, timer-settings, constant cooling, fan settings, a ""dry"" setting for humid heat, and a money-saver setting that maintains a set temperature in the room so that electric bills are reasonable. On the Money-Saver settings, the ACs go on and off based on the set temperature and the temperature in the room. There’s also a L43 Flat screen TV in a shared space.

THE APT. HAS: HARDWOOD FLOORS; HIGH CEILINGS; A LARGE (180 sq. ft.) EAT-IN KITCHEN (W/STONE FLOOR AND WHITE CERAMIC COUNTER AND WALL TILES); THICK WALLS; AND COLORED, RECESSED LIGHTING IN THE HALL AND LIVING ROOM.

THE LARGE EAT-IN KITCHEN is 180 sq. ft. and square, NOT a narrow, galley-style kitchen. It has a large round glass table with chairs, A LARGE DISHWASHER, LARGE FRIG., LARGE STOVETOP/OVEN, A NEW, LARGE MICROWAVE, a toaster, a Crockpot/slow-cooker, other cooking equipment, etc. and decent cabinet space. The kitchen doesn't get crowded with 2 people, depending on what is being done.

THE BUILDING: Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and it has a marble lobby and stairs. The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls. Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet. There is no noise from other apts.

Total utility charges for gas, electric, and shared internet vary, generally $60-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are rarely more than $100 for a single person, depending on how heavy A/C usage is.

ABOUT ME: I'm a Stanford U. and Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights. I currently do legal research and write legal memoranda for my cousin's practice. I sometimes do legal editing for law students' papers.

My male roommate in the 175' middle bedroom works in IT design for Bloomberg. I was born and raised in NYC, in Greenwich Village and Murray Hill. My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home). I do some of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library. We are easygoing, friendly, clean, and respect people's privacy and need for quiet.

Visitors and occasional overnight guests are OK, as long as you know them well, and don't have frequent overnights. Exceptions can be mutually agreed on.

Graduate students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all likely to be fine. A reference of some sort would be appreciated.

Mon-Thu Nights Only!! Quiet & Furn Private room Pied-A-Terre ,"If you are looking for a place to be in the city JUST A FEW NIGHTS per week, keep reading!

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative! This private room is available for part-time renters, people looking for a pied-a-terre. A place that you can come back repeatedly every week and paying for nightly prices. Ideal split schedules are something like Monday to Friday nights but feel free to reach out if you have another split schedule. I’m flexible.

Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Pied-a-Terre in Large Bedroom in 3BR Apt w/2BTH on Central Pak North!,"This is a GREAT, 1400 SQ. FT., RENOVATED 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apt. ACROSS THE STREET FROM CENTRAL PARK. There will be one other male roommate plus myself. A 150 sq.ft, partially-furnished double bedroom. The 175' bedroom is already rented/occupied. The space would be available PART-WEEK ONLY. I’m not looking for full-time renters. Just someone who would need a space for part of the week each week. Something like Monday to Friday nights or similar split schedules. 

The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and safe area.

There is a laundry room in the basement, and the air-conditioned living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side, all the way down Fifth Avenue to the Empire State Building.

The 150' bedroom has 1 large east-facing window and an A/C. The 175' bedroom next to the 150' bedroom has 2 large east-facing windows and an A/C. My bedroom/bathroom is in another wing of the 1400 sq. ft apartment, on the other side of the far living room wall. The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a private entrance to a bathroom shared with one male. That private entrance is from the apt's hall. The other guy is clean and he has a private entrance through his bedroom-to-bathroom door.

(The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a high-quality full (double-sized) mattress on a metal bed frame and boxspring, a small black wooden seat/nightstand; a straight-backed, black cushioned-leather black wood chair, a straight-backed red wood chair, a collapsible desk, and a walk-in, double-door closet.)

I have 1 cat. He stays in my room almost constantly. He's friendly but feels people out first by sniffing them.

Every room in the apt, including the living room, has the highest energy-efficiency air conditioners with numerous options: like digital temperature settings, timer-settings, constant cooling, fan settings, a ""dry"" setting for humid heat, and a money-saver setting that maintains a set temperature in the room so that electric bills are reasonable. On the Money-Saver settings, the ACs go on and off based on the set temperature and the temperature in the room. There’s also a L43 Flat screen TV in a shared space.

THE APT. HAS: HARDWOOD FLOORS; HIGH CEILINGS; A LARGE (180 sq. ft.) EAT-IN KITCHEN (W/STONE FLOOR AND WHITE CERAMIC COUNTER AND WALL TILES); THICK WALLS; AND COLORED, RECESSED LIGHTING IN THE HALL AND LIVING ROOM.

THE LARGE EAT-IN KITCHEN is 180 sq. ft. and square, NOT a narrow, galley-style kitchen. It has a large round glass table with chairs, A LARGE DISHWASHER, LARGE FRIG., LARGE STOVETOP/OVEN, A NEW, LARGE MICROWAVE, a toaster, a Crockpot/slow-cooker, other cooking equipment, etc. and decent cabinet space. The kitchen doesn't get crowded with 2 people, depending on what is being done.

THE BUILDING: Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and it has a marble lobby and stairs. The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls. Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet. There is no noise from other apts.

Total utility charges for gas, electric, and shared internet vary, generally $60-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are rarely more than $100 for a single person, depending on how heavy A/C usage is.

ABOUT ME: I'm a Stanford U. and Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights. I currently do legal research and write legal memoranda for my cousin's practice. I sometimes do legal editing for law students' papers.

My male roommate in the 175' middle bedroom works in IT design for Bloomberg. I was born and raised in NYC, in Greenwich Village and Murray Hill. My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home). I do some of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library. We are easygoing, friendly, clean, and respect people's privacy and need for quiet.

Visitors and occasional overnight guests are OK, as long as you know them well, and don't have frequent overnights. Exceptions can be mutually agreed on.

Graduate students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all likely to be fine. A reference of some sort would be appreciated.

M-thurs! Quiet & Furnished and Private room as a Pied-A-Terre,"Weekday Accommodation only! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers.

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative!

Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights. We are ideally looking for someone who needs a space for the weekdays each week for about 2 or 3 months. Monday to Thursday nights only!!

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

This is a GREAT, 1400 SQ. FT., RENOVATED 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apt. ACROSS THE STREET FROM CENTRAL PARK. There will be one other male roommate plus myself. A 150 sq.ft, partially-furnished double bedroom will be available beginning 11/30/22. The 175' bedroom is already rented/occupied. This private room is available for commuters or hybrid workers needing a place for part of the week each week, mostly for the returning to office schedule. You can store things in this place since you will be coming back each week. 

The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and safe area.

There is a laundry room in the basement, and the air-conditioned living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side, all the way down Fifth Avenue to the Empire State Building.

The 150' bedroom has 1 large east-facing window and an A/C. The 175' bedroom next to the 150' bedroom has 2 large east-facing windows and an A/C. My bedroom/bathroom is in another wing of the 1400 sq. ft apartment, on the other side of the far living room wall. The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a private entrance to a bathroom shared with one male. That private entrance is from the apt's hall. The other guy is clean and he has a private entrance through his bedroom-to-bathroom door.

(The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a high-quality full (double-sized) mattress on a metal bed frame and boxspring, a small black wooden seat/nightstand; a straight-backed, black cushioned-leather black wood chair, a straight-backed red wood chair, a collapsible desk, and a walk-in, double-door closet.)

Every room in the apt, including the living room, has the highest energy-efficiency air conditioners with numerous options: like digital temperature settings, timer-settings, constant cooling, fan settings, a ""dry"" setting for humid heat, and a money-saver setting that maintains a set temperature in the room so that electric bills are reasonable. On the Money-Saver settings, the ACs go on and off based on the set temperature and the temperature in the room. There’s also a L43 Flat screen TV in a shared space.

THE APT. HAS: HARDWOOD FLOORS; HIGH CEILINGS; A LARGE (180 sq. ft.) EAT-IN KITCHEN (W/STONE FLOOR AND WHITE CERAMIC COUNTER AND WALL TILES); THICK WALLS; AND COLORED, RECESSED LIGHTING IN THE HALL AND LIVING ROOM.

THE LARGE EAT-IN KITCHEN is 180 sq. ft. and square, NOT a narrow, galley-style kitchen. It has a large round glass table with chairs, A LARGE DISHWASHER, LARGE FRIG., LARGE STOVETOP/OVEN, A NEW, LARGE MICROWAVE, a toaster, a Crockpot/slow-cooker, other cooking equipment, etc. and decent cabinet space. The kitchen doesn't get crowded with 2 people, depending on what is being done.

THE BUILDING: Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and it has a marble lobby and stairs. The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls. Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet. There is no noise from other apts.

Total utility charges for gas, electric, and shared internet vary, generally $60-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are rarely more than $100 for a single person, depending on how heavy A/C usage is.

ABOUT ME: I'm a Stanford U. and Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights. I currently do legal research and write legal memoranda for my cousin's practice. I sometimes do legal editing for law students' papers.

My male roommate in the 175' middle bedroom works in IT design for Bloomberg. I was born and raised in NYC, in Greenwich Village and Murray Hill. My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home). I do some of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library. We are easygoing, friendly, clean, and respect people's privacy and need for quiet.

Graduate students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all likely to be fine. A reference of some sort would be appreciated.

Quiet & Furn Pied-A-Terre for Commuters Returning to Office,"Weekday Accommodation only! Available Monday to Thursday nights week after week

Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative!

Especially now with the RTO (returning to office) schedule, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Weekdays only Large Priv Bedroom in 3BR Apt w/2Bth on Central Pak North!,"This is a GREAT, 1400 SQ. FT., RENOVATED 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apt. ACROSS THE STREET FROM CENTRAL PARK. There will be one other male roommate plus myself. A 150 sq.ft, partially-furnished double bedroom is available. I'm looking for a renter who needs a place for their in-office days. Mon-Fri or similar split schedules. Your cost is calculated from the total room cost prorated to how many nights per week you use. Also, I would be happy to provide you with a storage space for you to leave your things during the time you are away.

The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and safe area.

There is a laundry room in the basement, and the air-conditioned living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side, all the way down Fifth Avenue to the Empire State Building.

The 150' bedroom has 1 large east-facing window and an A/C. The 175' bedroom next to the 150' bedroom has 2 large east-facing windows and an A/C. My bedroom/bathroom is in another wing of the 1400 sq. ft apartment, on the other side of the far living room wall. The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a private entrance to a bathroom shared with one male. That private entrance is from the apt's hall. The other guy is clean and he has a private entrance through his bedroom-to-bathroom door.

(The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a high-quality full (double-sized) mattress on a metal bed frame and boxspring, a small black wooden seat/nightstand; a straight-backed, black cushioned-leather black wood chair, a straight-backed red wood chair, a collapsible desk, and a walk-in, double-door closet.)

I have 1 cat. He stays in my room almost constantly. He's friendly but feels people out first by sniffing them.

Every room in the apt, including the living room, has the highest energy-efficiency air conditioners with numerous options: like digital temperature settings, timer-settings, constant cooling, fan settings, a ""dry"" setting for humid heat, and a money-saver setting that maintains a set temperature in the room so that electric bills are reasonable. On the Money-Saver settings, the ACs go on and off based on the set temperature and the temperature in the room. There’s also a L43 Flat screen TV in a shared space.

THE APT. HAS: HARDWOOD FLOORS; HIGH CEILINGS; A LARGE (180 sq. ft.) EAT-IN KITCHEN (W/STONE FLOOR AND WHITE CERAMIC COUNTER AND WALL TILES); THICK WALLS; AND COLORED, RECESSED LIGHTING IN THE HALL AND LIVING ROOM.

THE LARGE EAT-IN KITCHEN is 180 sq. ft. and square, NOT a narrow, galley-style kitchen. It has a large round glass table with chairs, A LARGE DISHWASHER, LARGE FRIG., LARGE STOVETOP/OVEN, A NEW, LARGE MICROWAVE, a toaster, a Crockpot/slow-cooker, other cooking equipment, etc. and decent cabinet space. The kitchen doesn't get crowded with 2 people, depending on what is being done.

THE BUILDING: Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and it has a marble lobby and stairs. The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls. Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet. There is no noise from other apts.

Total utility charges for gas, electric, and shared internet vary, generally $60-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are rarely more than $100 for a single person, depending on how heavy A/C usage is.

ABOUT ME: I'm a Stanford U. and Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights. I currently do legal research and write legal memoranda for my cousin's practice. I sometimes do legal editing for law students' papers.

My male roommate in the 175' middle bedroom works in IT design for Bloomberg. I was born and raised in NYC, in Greenwich Village and Murray Hill. My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home). I do some of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library. We are easygoing, friendly, clean, and respect people's privacy and need for quiet.

Visitors and occasional overnight guests are OK, as long as you know them well, and don't have frequent overnights. Exceptions can be mutually agreed on.

Graduate students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all likely to be fine. A reference of some sort would be appreciated.

Quiet & Furn Private bedroom available Mon-Thu Nights Only!,"Weekday Accommodation only! For commuters or ""hybrid"" workers. Weekdays accommodation only! This private bedroom is available for commuters or hybrid workers needing a place for part of the week each week, mostly for the returning to office schedule. You can store things in this place since you will be coming back each week. Paying a fortune for hotels during the workweek? Here's a much better alternative!

Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Otherwise there is a parking lot across the street for $13/hr or $35/24 hrs, which is pretty cheap for Manhattan.

This is ideal for commuters or hybrid workers that are returning to the office. You will pay nightly prices and you can leave your things in your room while you are away!

The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and safe area.

There is a laundry room in the basement, and the air-conditioned living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side, all the way down Fifth Avenue to the Empire State Building.

The 150' bedroom has 1 large east-facing window and an A/C. The 175' bedroom next to the 150' bedroom has 2 large east-facing windows and an A/C. My bedroom/bathroom is in another wing of the 1400 sq. ft apartment, on the other side of the far living room wall. The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a private entrance to a bathroom shared with one male. That private entrance is from the apt's hall. The other guy is clean and he has a private entrance through his bedroom-to-bathroom door.

(The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a high-quality full (double-sized) mattress on a metal bed frame and boxspring, a small black wooden seat/nightstand; a straight-backed, black cushioned-leather black wood chair, a straight-backed red wood chair, a collapsible desk, and a walk-in, double-door closet.)

I have 1 cat. He stays in my room almost constantly. He's friendly but feels people out first by sniffing them.

Every room in the apt, including the living room, has the highest energy-efficiency air conditioners with numerous options: like digital temperature settings, timer-settings, constant cooling, fan settings, a ""dry"" setting for humid heat, and a money-saver setting that maintains a set temperature in the room so that electric bills are reasonable. On the Money-Saver settings, the ACs go on and off based on the set temperature and the temperature in the room. There’s also a L43 Flat screen TV in a shared space.

THE APT. HAS: HARDWOOD FLOORS; HIGH CEILINGS; A LARGE (180 sq. ft.) EAT-IN KITCHEN (W/STONE FLOOR AND WHITE CERAMIC COUNTER AND WALL TILES); THICK WALLS; AND COLORED, RECESSED LIGHTING IN THE HALL AND LIVING ROOM.

THE LARGE EAT-IN KITCHEN is 180 sq. ft. and square, NOT a narrow, galley-style kitchen. It has a large round glass table with chairs, A LARGE DISHWASHER, LARGE FRIG., LARGE STOVETOP/OVEN, A NEW, LARGE MICROWAVE, a toaster, a Crockpot/slow-cooker, other cooking equipment, etc. and decent cabinet space. The kitchen doesn't get crowded with 2 people, depending on what is being done.

THE BUILDING: Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and it has a marble lobby and stairs. The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls. Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet. There is no noise from other apts.

Total utility charges for gas, electric, and shared internet vary, generally $60-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are rarely more than $100 for a single person, depending on how heavy A/C usage is.

ABOUT ME: I'm a Stanford U. and Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights. I currently do legal research and write legal memoranda for my cousin's practice. I sometimes do legal editing for law students' papers.

My male roommate in the 175' middle bedroom works in IT design for Bloomberg. I was born and raised in NYC, in Greenwich Village and Murray Hill. My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home). I do some of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library. We are easygoing, friendly, clean, and respect people's privacy and need for quiet.

Visitors and occasional overnight guests are OK, as long as you know them well, and don't have frequent overnights. Exceptions can be mutually agreed on.

Graduate students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all likely to be fine. A reference of some sort would be appreciated.

Especially now with covid19, more people are being asked to do only 2-3 days per week in the actual office. And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Hybrid worker commute solution on Central Park North!,"Need a more convenient and home-like option than hotels when visiting your children in NYC on a repeated schedule? Our bedroom is available for part-time renters, with flexible scheduling and nightly prices. Feel free to reach out and ask any questions you may have as long as you have a repeated schedule to be in the city week after week, like Monday to Thursday nights.

The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and safe area.

There is a laundry room in the basement, and the air-conditioned living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side, all the way down Fifth Avenue to the Empire State Building.

The 150' bedroom has 1 large east-facing window and an A/C. The 175' bedroom next to the 150' bedroom has 2 large east-facing windows and an A/C. My bedroom/bathroom is in another wing of the 1400 sq. ft apartment, on the other side of the far living room wall. The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a private entrance to a bathroom shared with one male. That private entrance is from the apt's hall. The other guy is clean and he has a private entrance through his bedroom-to-bathroom door.

(The 150 sq. ft bedroom has a high-quality full (double-sized) mattress on a metal bed frame and boxspring, a small black wooden seat/nightstand; a straight-backed, black cushioned-leather black wood chair, a straight-backed red wood chair, a collapsible desk, and a walk-in, double-door closet.)

I have 1 cat. He stays in my room almost constantly. He's friendly but feels people out first by sniffing them.

Every room in the apt, including the living room, has the highest energy-efficiency air conditioners with numerous options: like digital temperature settings, timer-settings, constant cooling, fan settings, a ""dry"" setting for humid heat, and a money-saver setting that maintains a set temperature in the room so that electric bills are reasonable. On the Money-Saver settings, the ACs go on and off based on the set temperature and the temperature in the room. There’s also a L43 Flat screen TV in a shared space.

THE APT. HAS: HARDWOOD FLOORS; HIGH CEILINGS; A LARGE (180 sq. ft.) EAT-IN KITCHEN (W/STONE FLOOR AND WHITE CERAMIC COUNTER AND WALL TILES); THICK WALLS; AND COLORED, RECESSED LIGHTING IN THE HALL AND LIVING ROOM.

THE LARGE EAT-IN KITCHEN is 180 sq. ft. and square, NOT a narrow, galley-style kitchen. It has a large round glass table with chairs, A LARGE DISHWASHER, LARGE FRIG., LARGE STOVETOP/OVEN, A NEW, LARGE MICROWAVE, a toaster, a Crockpot/slow-cooker, other cooking equipment, etc. and decent cabinet space. The kitchen doesn't get crowded with 2 people, depending on what is being done.

THE BUILDING: Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and it has a marble lobby and stairs. The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls. Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet. There is no noise from other apts.

Total utility charges for gas, electric, and shared internet vary, generally $60-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are rarely more than $100 for a single person, depending on how heavy A/C usage is.

ABOUT ME: I'm a Stanford U. and Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights. I currently do legal research and write legal memoranda for my cousin's practice. I sometimes do legal editing for law students' papers.

My male roommate in the 175' middle bedroom works in IT design for Bloomberg. I was born and raised in NYC, in Greenwich Village and Murray Hill. My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home). I do some of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library. We are easygoing, friendly, clean, and respect people's privacy and need for quiet.

Visitors and occasional overnight guests are OK, as long as you know them well, and don't have frequent overnights. Exceptions can be mutually agreed on.

Graduate students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all likely to be fine. A reference of some sort would be appreciated.

Quiet & Furn Part-Week Rentals for Commuters and Hybrid Workers in NYC,"Looking for a part-time rental that fits your hybrid work schedule? Our shared apartment is available from Monday to Friday and offers nightly prices, storage options, and flexibility for those with different split schedules.

And this is much better than a hotel because you are the room's sole occupant so you don't have to worry about the germs of other prior guests!

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with a double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, in Northern Manhattan/Hudson Heights.

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.

Since we're a couple, we require Monday-to-Friday roommates, or ""commuters"" or ""part-time tenants"" so we can have some time to ourselves. We've been sharing for years, both individually and together, and through trial and error, have found what works for us.
Therefore, our ideal roommate would be a reliable, quiet, drama-free, employed professional, 50+, who will be away, that is, sleeping somewhere other than the apartment, every weekend. To us, the weekend is Friday evening through Monday daytime. Weekdays are Monday through Thursday nights.

All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term, i. e. at least 6 months.

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy an L7 Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.

Return to Office Schedule Pied-A-Terre Available Manhattan,"I'm looking for a renter who needs a place for their in-office days. Mon-Fri or similar split schedules. Your cost is calculated from the total room cost prorated to how many nights per week you use. Also, I would be happy to provide you with a storage space for you to leave your things during the time you are away.

We are offering a good-sized (10 x11.5 feet) room, furnished with a double bed, closet, chair and desk plus recliner, 

The apartment is in a prewar (early 1900s) building. It's a large high-ceilinged 4 bedroom with a huge living room, separate kitchen, and large bathroom. Reliable card laundry facilities (3 large washers, 4 dryers) are available in the basement.

Located in Hudson Heights, west of Broadway, one block from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Nursing School, and the A, C, and 1 subway lines, it's a 15-20 minute ride on the A Express to midtown. It's also very near lots of banks, shops, restaurants, 24-hour delis, grocery stores and even a Starbucks- all of life's necessities within easy walking distance. And it's just a few subway stops or a short bus ride from Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters Museum. We don't have a car, but on-street parking appears to be available. There are also quite a few nearby parking garages.

You'd be sharing with three people- us, a quiet, settled married couple (M/F) together for 15 years, who, although we’re in the arts, don’t have artistic temperaments, (which is why we’re looking for a business type/medical/prof. etc) and a late sixtyish university professor who is also out of the city every weekend.


All our past roommates have had to be in NYC for work, but had a house and family elsewhere, outside of daily commuting distance. Someone relatively tidy and clean but not obsessive about it is best. Absolutely NO smokers/substance abusers etc. please, and no pets. It's a month-to month agreement, but we prefer long-term. 

The monthly rent includes all bills- gas, electric, domestic phone, internet, and cable. You can also enjoy a Flat Screen TV. A personal cable box for your room is an option for an extra $10/month. 1st month's rent plus one month security deposit is required to move in. A written rental agreement will protect both our interests.
